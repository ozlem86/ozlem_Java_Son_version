    1) we need constructor to create an object from a class.
    ") when we create a class java puts a constructor in it, because java knows classes are for creating object
    3)when we create a class you will not see any constructor in it, but the class has constructor,
    it is invisible constructor.
    4)Invisible constructors are called "default constructors".
    5) to create a constructor fallow the steps;
    a:use access modifier mostly we use "public"
    b: use class name as constructor
    c: Open close constructor parenthesis
    d:Open close curly braces.
    6)When you create constructor manually Java will delete the "default constructor".
    7)We can create many constructor in a class
       a:constructors names will be same, bec. every constructors uses class name as name
       b: every constructor must have different parameters
    8)What are the differences between method and the constructor?  (interviews questions)
      a:Methods have return type but constructors dont have
      b:Methods are for some actions, but constructors are for object creation.
