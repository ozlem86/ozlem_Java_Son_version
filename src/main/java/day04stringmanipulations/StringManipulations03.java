            What did we learn today:
                1)charAt() ==> char
                2)toUpperCase() ==> String
                3)toLowerCase() ==> String
                4)trim() ==> String
                5)split() ==> We will learn it later
                6)length() ==> int
                7)substring(beginning Index, Ending Index) ==> String
                8)substring(beginning Index) ==> String
                9)equals() ==> boolean
                10)equalsIgnoreCase() ==> boolean
                11)startsWith() ==> boolean

                Note: When you learn method in Java, you should learn
                        i)What does the method do?
                        ii)What are the different usages?
                        iii)What does the method give you?
